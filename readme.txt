Karyn Black, Informatics B.S., transfer student that is around a Junior level in class credits
Was born in Phoenix, Arizona. Grew up in Stevensville, Michigan. Went back to AZ for over a decade. Now I'm here in Indianapolis, Indiana.
I currently work by delivering for GrubHub. My passion is Data Visualization. I am currently taking a GIS course this semester. May want to go into that field.
I am feeling stressed out about this course right now!
